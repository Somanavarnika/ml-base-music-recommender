This project presents a Music Recommendation System developed using machine learning techniques. The system analyzes user preferences and listening behavior to suggest suitable music tracks. A neural network model is used to process user-related factors and predict music genres that match the user’s mood and interests. By providing personalized recommendations, the project aims to enhance the overall user listening experience.
